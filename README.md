The DREAM RET System
====================

![DREAM Logo]

This repository covers a software system for Robot Enhanced Therapy (RET) aimed to treat children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). This system was developed within the research project [DREAM: Development of Robot-enhanced Therapy for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders](http://dream2020.eu), funded by the 7th Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Commission, grant 611391. The project started in April 2014 and finished March 2019. 

This software system is described in detail in [Cai et al. (2019)](doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2018.2877662).
See also [Esteban et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1515/pjbr-2017-0002) and [Cao et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1109/MRA.2019.2904121) for a broader presentation of this approach to autism therapy.
