DREAM stands for Development of Robot-enhanced Therapy for Children with
Autism Spectrum Disorders. The project started in April 2014 and will
finish in September 2018. It is funded by the European Commission under
the 7th Framework Programme.

The wiki is mainly used to provide documentation to help develop and use
the DREAM software. However, it also provide access to DREAM resources
that are restricted to the project partners (e.g. review presentations)
as well as links to public information on the DREAM website (e.g.
deliverables).
